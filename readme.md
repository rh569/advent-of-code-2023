# Advent of Code 2023

Attempting this year with rust

## Log

**--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---**

Read through the first day of 'Comprehensive Rust' and jumped straight into sliding windows of strings... so a much harder opener than other years - punishing several naive approaches that would normally slide for a few days.

Final code is not pretty, with some gross labelled loop...break blocks.

**--- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---**

Used today's puzzles to try out some of the functional features of iterators and am fairly happy with the result. The top-level funcitons are nice and readable. The inner workings of the input parsing: less so.

**--- Day 3: Gear Ratios ---**

Enjoyed day 3, but didn't get to it until the 4th. Solution is fairly clean, but didn't get a huge amount of reuse between parts 1 and 2.
